# Java8 new Features studies
Java 7 & 8 new features, enhancements Zero to Master' course will help in understanding all the new features from Java 7 and 8 releases. In this course we will discuss all the new features in detail both in theory and coding. Special attention and explanation given to all the major features like Lambda Expressions, Streams, JODA Date time, Default & Static methods, Optional, Method References, Functional Interfaces, Try-With-Resources statement in this course. During the course discussion, each feature will be covered first with theory explanation followed by a detailed code walkthrough and execution. You have a flexibility to skip any feature that you already know since the course is organized in such a way where skipping a known feature will not impact other sections/lectures.

All the material discussed in the course will be provided to all the enrolled students along with a GitHub repository details where the entire code discussed in the course is maintained. Each section is followed by a quiz to test your understanding at regular intervals.
